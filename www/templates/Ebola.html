      If the patient has both exposure and symptoms, immediately separate the patient and inform others.</p>
    <h4>Prevention</h4>
    <p>There is no FDA-approved vaccine available for Ebola.</br>If you travel to or are in an area affected by an Ebola outbreak, make sure to do the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Practice careful hygiene. For example, wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and avoid contact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, feces, saliva, sweat, urine, vomit, breast milk, semen, and vaginal fluids).Pract</li>
        <li>Do not handle items that may have come in contact with an infected personâ€™s blood or body fluids (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).</li>
        <li>Avoid funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who has died from Ebola.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid contact with bats and nonhuman primates or blood, fluids, and raw meat prepared from these animals.</li>
        <li>Avoid facilities in West Africa where Ebola patients are being treated. The U.S. embassy or consulate is often able to provide advice on facilities.</li>
        <li>Avoid contact with semen from a man who has had Ebola until you know Ebola is gone from his semen.</li>
        <li>After you return, monitor your health for 21 days and seek medical care immediately if you develop symptoms of Ebola.</li>
        <li>Wear adequate protective equipments and avoid contact with body fluid when contact with the patient</li>
        <li>If you haven't been in close contact with the patient, avoid the area at all cost and quickly go to the nearest healthcare centre to get checked.</li>
      </ul></p>
